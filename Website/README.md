## Name of domain: 
merlinproperty.com.au

## Type of site: 
sole trader Cleaning business page

## what do you do: 
end of lease cleaning, move in, commercial cleaning, presale, gardening, minor maintenance, then miscellaneous things like hang curtains, shelves, painting 

## why offer so many different services: 
most cleaners only offer end of lease cleaning i think thats silly because when moving out more than just the inside needs cleaning usually its the garden then any items that need fixing i try position myself as i can take care of the entire moveout process.

## how i want my site to feel:
user experience is upmost important the user should land on my page and instantly see what they need to without much hassle, things like main navigation to what you want, end of lease, gardening ect wich then takes you to a page dedicated to that service and its pricing, description, my garuntee ect

## what i want on my website:
the landing page i.e main navigation should be elegent easily readable and only contain my business name as a header and then cards with each service on it.
service cards when clicked will take you to the landing page of that service i.e end of lease would show 100% bond back garuntee, fully insured scroll below to see pricing and availability so the user instantly has what they want and same for the rest of the services.

## what i dont want:
no testimonials
a template like style page
